Hi, I am Yongchan Kwon, a term Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. My research focuses on developing more interpretable and rigorous machine learning methods, directly motivated by scientific questions. I received a Ph.D. at Seoul National University (fortunately advised by Prof. [Myunghee Cho Paik](https://mcpstat.github.io/)) and did postdoc at Stanford (luckily advised by Prof. [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/)).
