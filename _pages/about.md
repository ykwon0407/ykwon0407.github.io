Hi, I am Yongchan Kwon, a term Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My research focuses on developing more interpretable and rigorous machine learning methods, directly motivated by scientific questions. I received a Ph.D. at Seoul National University (Advisor: Prof. [Myunghee Cho Paik](https://mcpstat.github.io/)) and did postdoc at Stanford University (Mentor: Prof. [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/)).
